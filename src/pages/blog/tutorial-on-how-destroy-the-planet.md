# Tutorial on how to destroy the planet

First, i need to say that destroy the planet is a very hard task, but we will list here some ways to end this place we call Earth. Second, none of this methods listed here are easy to access, actually they are completely inaccessible, so don't worry to share this article.

Our planet are roughly 4.5 billion years old (if you believe) and stays still. Has resisted millions asteroid impacts which sizes varies from a small car to corpus of the size of planet Mars - actually this is one of the theories about the origin of Moon where a stray planet about the size of mars collided with Earth and remaining shreds of the impact generated, fist a ring like Saturn, and later the Moon, but i digress.

It is a semi-sphere with 5,973,600,000,000,000,000,000 (5 sextillion) ton of basic iron. Has 12km diameter, 510.100.000km² of area and it is not a plane disc supported by 4 elephants above a gigantic cosmic turtle.

But speaking about total annihilation of the planet, most probably we will annihilate yourselves with our own attitudes. Either for a thermonuclear warfare or by climate change, we are doing a good work to turn this planet a hostile environment.

But if your plan is to put end to this misery and don't know how to start, take note for some methods that could be valuable on this journey.

### Total annihilation by anti-matter

*Anti-matter* is the most explosive material you could imagine and will be necessary a quantity with the size of another planet. It is possible to create *anti-matter* here on Earth with a particle accelerator, but in very small quantities, which will take much time to accumulate the quantity we will need.

We will need to manufacture all *anti-matter* in space and not so far away from here because once we have the target quantity, we have to throw towards Earth, which will produce a quantity of energy equivalent to all energy liberated by the Sun in 89 million years, all in single moment. All that will last will be energy expanding across the universe.

### Doomsday centrifugation

We all know how centrifugal force works:

Imagine if it's possible to accelerate the planetary rotation with rockets at the equator's line, fixed with some adequate angle to accelerate Earth's rotation to way beyond 1 complete revolution every 24h but like 1 revolution every 80 minutes. This will be sufficient to flatten the semi-spherical shape even more with large chunks of curst coming off until remain only exposed magma. In this case, moments before the apocalypse, ultra fast winds not only would rip off your clothesline but smooth the entire Earth's surface, removing mountains and valleys with dust and water. Be advised.

### Hit with a large enough rock

Everything can be destroyed with adequate brute force. So, find a big rock, maybe Mars, accelerate to a enormous velocity and throw towards Earth. The impact would pulverize both of them, where the chunks, dust and magma hardly aggregate again in a new rock formation, remaining only a large asteroid belt. But you need to make an effort. It's possible with a smaller rock, like a 5,000,000,000,000 ton asteroid, but will be necessary to accelerate more, maybe 90% speed of light could be sufficient.

### Kill with fire

The obvious solution would be to throw Earth in to the Sun and let the 5504ºc heat melt the planet in to vaporized iron ball, slowly engulfed by Sun's gravity. It's all right that if Earth's rotation around the Sun stop, the planet would be slowly pulled towards the middle of the solar system. But more impossible to change Earth's orbit to inner orbits, it is to stop Earth's orbit at all.

But remember that our Sun is in the middle of it's life span and in 5 billon years it will give your last breath. When the nuclear fusion fuel finish, the Sun's atmosphere will expand and swallow Mercury, Venus and maybe Earth. Even if Earth will not be engulfed, it will be the end for live on Earth with the Sun's atmosphere so close to us. Would be a global warming with superpowers.

### Wormhole to the end of time

Anyone who has watched Interstellar from Christopher Nolan knows a good visual representation of a *Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen* bridge, also known as *wormhole*. Characters in the movie goes inside one of those and travel across *time-space* to a alien solar system with planets orbiting a beautiful black hole.

With such technology to open *wormholes* on demand and with some level of accuracy to connect point A to B, there are many possibilities. We could connect the center of our planet to a black hole and be suck from inside out, or connect to the center of a red giant and explode greatly, any way, we could do a lot of things if all of this were possible. *Wormholes* are hypothetical and scientifically improbable astronomical object. 

### Honorable mention: Atomic bombs

Speaking of total annihilation, atomic bombs, even all human arsenal trigger all at same time, would not make the slightest difference to the planet. Certainly are terrible weapons to the living, but to Earth, meh!

### Honorable mention: Existence denied by time travel

Very simple: Hop in to your time machine, go back 4.5 billion years and prevent the Earth's protoplanetary disc aggregate and form the planet we have today. Seems very hard but is more likely impossible as time travel to the past is a violation of relativity theory, maybe to the future, if you are fast enough.


### Honorable mention: Evil gamma rays

Gama rays are terrible. It's a kind of hi-frequency electromagnetic radiation produced by astronomical events of great violence capable of make a human extreme strong with green skin. In this case we need to be close to a massive star with more than 40x Sun's mass. Even *Betelgeuse*, which is one of the largest stars known, has only 20x solar mass. So would be necessary to be close to *Eta Carinae*, which has 140x solar mass but is ~7500 light years from here. But even so, the gamma rays would have no effect on the planetary body. What a shame.
